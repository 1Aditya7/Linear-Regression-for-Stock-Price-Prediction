# Stock Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## 1. Introduction
This project aims to predict stock prices using historical closing prices from the National Stock Exchange of India (NSE) data retrieved from Yahoo Finance. I will utilize the linear regression to model the relationship between time (as represented by an integer index) and stock prices. This README provides an overview of the methodology, exploratory data analysis (EDA), results, and conclusions drawn from the analysis.

## 2. Methodology
We collected stock price data for the NSE using the Yahoo Finance library, focusing on the historical closing prices for analysis. The choice of closing prices as the independent feature is justified by their significance in financial analysis, reflecting the final consensus price of the stock for the trading day. Closing prices are commonly used in technical analysis due to their perceived stability and reliability, making them suitable for predictive modeling.

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Several EDA techniques were employed to better understand the dataset, including:
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizing key metrics such as mean, median, and standard deviation of the closing prices.
- **Time Series Visualization**: Plotting the closing prices over time to identify trends, seasonal patterns, or anomalies.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examining the relationship between the closing price and potential influencing factors, confirming the independence of our feature.
- **Residual Analysis**: Assessing the residuals of our model to check for patterns that might indicate model inadequacies.

## 4. Approach
The approach to modeling included using linear regression, where the independent variable \(X\) is represented by the integer index of the dates, and the dependent variable \(Y\) is the predicted closing stock price. The linear regression model can be mathematically expressed as:

```math
[ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X + \epsilon \]
```

where:
- \(Y\) = Predicted Closing Price
- \(X\) = Integer Date Index
- \(\beta_0\) = Intercept
- \(\beta_1\) = Slope (coefficient)
- \(\epsilon\) = Error term


## 5. Results
The model's evaluation yielded several important metrics. The coefficient and intercept provide insights into the relationship between time and stock prices. The coefficient indicates how much the stock price is expected to change for each unit increase in time, while the intercept indicates the expected price when the time index is zero.

### Inferences from the Train Set Graph
The graph of the training set illustrates the model's fit to the historical closing prices, showing how well the linear regression line represents the actual data points.

### Inferences from Model Evaluation
Evaluation metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared value offer quantitative insights into the model's performance. An R-squared close to 1 indicates a strong correlation between the predicted and actual prices, signifying that our model captures a substantial amount of variance in the data.

### Inferences from Subplots
The subplot analysis reveals patterns and distributions of the residuals, confirming the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity, which are critical for validating our regression model.

### Inferences from All Plots
Overall, the visualizations provided a comprehensive view of model performance, showing that while our model performs well, there are still residuals that may warrant further exploration.

## 6. Error Evaluation Metrics
The following error evaluation metrics were calculated to assess model performance:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 
  \[ MAE = \frac{1}{n} \sum |y_i - \hat{y}_i| \]
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 
  \[ MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 \]
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: 
  \[ RMSE = \sqrt{MSE} \]

## 7. Accuracy Evaluation Metrics
The accuracy of the model was assessed using:
- **R-squared (RÂ²)**: 
  \[ R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{res}}{SS_{tot}} \]
  where \(SS_{res}\) is the residual sum of squares and \(SS_{tot}\) is the total sum of squares.

## 8. Limitations and Future Scope
While the model provides reasonable predictions, it has limitations, such as:
- Dependence on historical data, which may not account for future market anomalies or events.
- Potential for overfitting, especially with more complex models.
Future work may explore incorporating additional features, such as economic indicators, trading volumes, or even sentiment analysis from financial news, to enhance predictive power.

## 9. Conclusions
In conclusion, this project demonstrates the application of linear regression for stock price prediction using closing prices from NSE. The EDA and model evaluation provided insights into the effectiveness of the model and highlighted areas for improvement. This foundational work sets the stage for future research and development in financial modeling.
